            </p>
            <p class="tsdescrip">The lighthouse is a 65-foot-tall (20 meters) octagonal stone tower. It is located on top of the Vigia de Nagpartian Hill in Barangay Bayog overlooking Cape Bojeador (the northwestern tip of the island of Luzon) where galleons used to sail by. It was built during the Spanish Colonial period as part of the Spanish government’s master plan of illuminating the Philippine archipelago. The Cape Bojeador Lighthouse was designed by Engineer Magin Pers Y Pers in 1887. It is the oldest lighthouse in the Philippines as it is still operating since it was first lit on 30 March 1892. The lighthouse is still guiding cargo vessels, ships and local fishermen from the giant waves of West Philippine Sea and rocky coast of Burgos. The lighthouse has a courtyard and a pavilion which has been turned into a museum.


            Cape Bojeador Lighthouse was declared a National Historical Landmark on August 13, 2004 and a National Cultural Treasure on June 20, 2005 by the Philippine Government.  It is the most visited tourist attraction in Ilocos Norte

            </p>
            <p class="tsdescrip">The Kapurpurawan Rock Formation is located on the rocky coast of Barangay Poblacion fronting the crystal blue water of the West Philippine Sea. It is known for its limestone formation, which was formed thousand years ago through the accumulation of particles deposited to the shore by sea waves and wind. “kapurpurawan” is derived from an Ilocano word “puraw” which means white, because of the cream-colored rock formation that sparkles in the sun. Along the coral shore of the “Kapurpurawan” is the “gagamtan” (Nori Seaweed) harvesting area. Due to erosion and vandalism on the walls of the rock formation, the local government has restricted exploration of tourists on the rock formation and viewing is allowed only at a distance.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="tsdescrip">The privately owned EDC (Energy Development Corporation) Burgos Wind Farm Corporation (EDCBWFC) is located in three adjacent barangays (Nagsurot, Poblacion, and Saoit). It is the largest wind farm in Southeast Asia and the first combined wind and solar renewable energy plant in Northern Philippines. It covers an area of more than 6.86 square kilometers (686 hectares) with 50 wind turbines having a total capacity of 150 Megawatts. The construction of the wind farm started in 2013 and completed in 2015. The farm harnesses energy from the wind and sun, and contributes power to the Luzon Grid.  The windfarm is a favorite destination of tourists to see the towering iconic wind turbines. Noting that the wind farm has boosted the tourism industry of Burgos, the local government of Burgos and the EDCBWFC put up the Burgos Wind Farm Adventure Park in Barangay Nagsurot in 2017.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="tsdescrip">The multi-tiered Kaangrian Falls is located in the outskirt of Barangay Agaga (13 kilometers from town center). Small sparkling pools around the base of the waterfalls are created by limestone deposits. A wide variety of flora and fauna including wild edible mushrooms are endemic to the area. 


            It was discovered by the local government of Burgos in 1998 as it was looking for sources of water. By word of mouth, the falls became a popular place for campers and nature enthusiasts.
