            HISTORY OF BURGOS
        </a>
    </p>

    <p class="dhstry">
        Burgos was first known as Nagparitan because a group of wild and fierce people who were extra-ordinarily tall known as Mamburi prohibited the Christians especially the Malayans to settle and build their homes, who likewise fled from the ravages of fierce and cruel Moros who frequented the coastal settlements of the Northwestern region of Luzon.<br><br>

        Burgos was not easy to access either by land or by sea at the time so, feeling safer in this mountainous part of the region, the evacuees decided to stay in Nagparitan and held their ground. They were able to do so with the valiant defence achieved by the brave men among the Christians called Sarapa, Riuac, Ambayog and Serrano. They planted bamboos around Nagparitan to strengthen their defenses.<br><br>

        The Spaniards settled in Nagparitan. But because of hard labor, slavery and other oppressing acts by the Spaniards, the people staged a revolt, captured a priest, dismembered parts of his body and scattered them in the locality. It was believed that soil where the body parts had been thrown turned red because at present there are parts of the locality wherein the soil is red. Due to this incident, the Spaniards changed the name Nagparitan which means “prohibit” to Nagpartian which means “place of slaughter”.
